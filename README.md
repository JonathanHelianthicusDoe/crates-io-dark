# crates-io-dark

A smol dark theme for [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

## Important Note

**NOTE:** crates.io now mangles class/id names, which unfortunately sort of
thwarts the ability to apply a usercss. Until [my PR to the crates.io
repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/2076) gets merged, I will try
to keep this usercss working but I cannot give any guarantees.

## Install

Install [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and then
use Stylus to install [the crates-io-dark usercss][usercss].
